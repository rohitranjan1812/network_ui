    - name: "Canvas"
      type: "HTML5 Canvas or WebGL for performance."
      features:
        - "High-performance rendering capable of handling thousands of nodes/edges."
        - "Smooth zooming and panning."
        - "Anti-aliasing for crisp visuals."

  functionalities:

      description: "Node and Edge Rendering."
      details:
        - "Render nodes with customizable geometry (circle, square), size, and color."
        - "Render edges with customizable width, color, style (solid, dashed), and directionality (arrows)."
        - "Display labels for nodes and edges."
    - id: "F-GV-002"
      description: "Interactive Layout Algorithms."
      details:
        - "Force-directed layout (e.g., Fruchterman-Reingold)."
        - "Hierarchical/Tree layout."

    - id: "F-GV-003"
      description: "Direct Manipulation."
      details:
        - "Drag and drop nodes to manually adjust their positions."
        - "Select single or multiple nodes/edges."
        - "Context menu (right-click) on elements to access actions (e.g., view details, delete)."
    - id: "F-GV-004"
      description: "Data-driven Visualization."
      details:
        - "Map node/edge attributes to visual properties."
        - "Example: Node size mapped to 'degree centrality', edge width mapped to 'weight'."
        - "Provide a UI for creating and managing these visual mapping rules."
    - id: "F-GV-005"
      description: "Highlighting and Filtering."
      details:
        - "Highlight nodes/edges based on selection, search results, or analysis output."
        - "Filter the view to show/hide nodes/edges based on attribute values."
